/** This class provides a simple way of generating a movie from a series of 'images' (CVPixelBufferRefs or CGContextRefs).
 
 Simply implement the 3 status methods and 1 (ONE and only ONE) of the optional frame provider methods.
 
 Init a new instance of this class, set the delegate to wherever you've implemented the apropriate delegate methods and call -(void)startRequestingFrames.
 
 Your frame provider method will be handed a pointer to either a CVPixelBufferRef or a CGContextRef (depending on which you've implemented).  Fill the bitmap or buffer and return a BOOL to say if you've filled it.
 
 As soon as you return NO the the movie encoding is finished and written to disk.
 
 A simple frame provider class might look like this: (note that if you are providing frames from the class you declared the movie encoder in you can get the frame size directly from the encoder when you need it.)
 
 CGSize frameSize;
 int counter;
 
 -(id)init {

		 frameSize = CGSizeMake(1280, 720);

	 CGContextSetRGBFillColor(context, 0,0,1,1); //RED
	 CGContextFillRect(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, frameSize.width, frameSize.height));
	 
	 CGContextSetRGBFillColor(context, 1,0,0,0.5); //BLUE with alpha of 0.5
	 CGContextFillEllipseInRect(context, CGRectMake(1*counter, 200, 1*counter, 1*counter));
	 return YES;

	//all that's left is the remaining compression (very quick)
	NSLog(@"All frames added");
 }
 
 -(void)movieEncoderDidFinishEncoding {
	//it's actually finished now, you can release it, if you like you can ask for the fileURL first so you know where the movie went
	NSLog(@"Movie written to disk");
 }
 
 -(void)movieEncoderDidFailWithReason:(NSString *)reason {
	//it's failed.  It's in an unpredictable state, the movie may exist but it's probably garbage if it does.
	NSLog(@"%@", reason);
 }
 
 
 This class offers insanely good performance (through trial and error).  The key is that the assetWriter is writing in BGRA format.  Encoding 500 720p H264 frames in RGBA takes about 3 minutes.
 Encoding the same in BGRA takes under 30 seconds.  Why?  I have no idea, presumably the HW encoder is BGRA and everything else has to be manually rotated in the CPU (weird).

 Note that to set a colour in this context you should use:

 CGContextSetRGBFillColor(context, BLUE,GREEN,RED,ALPHA); (The colours are in reverse order, the alpha is in the same place)

 ie. CGContextSetRGBFillColor(context, 0,0,1.0,0.5); is 100% red with a 50% alpha.

 For this slight annoyance of backwards colour declaration you get a 7x performance increase. */
